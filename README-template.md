### What I learned

This is my first (submitted) FrontendMentor project. I've done a couple and haven't uploaded them but this is my first Javascript project and I learned a lot.

I've only been learning JS for a about a week and I think I can get the grasp of it eventually.

Seeing with how JS and Tailwind interact with eachother is interesting.

### Continued development

I want to get better at frontend learning in all remarks. I have the understanding of HTML and CSS, but JS will take a bit.

### Useful resources

HTML/CSS - (https://www.youtube.com/@kevinpowell) Kevin is a great teacher for HTML/CSS. Everything I've learned so far is from him. He expains things great in an easy and in-depth way.

JS # 1 (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
This was my first resorce for learning JS. It's pretty good, easy to learn but don't seem to get updated.

JS # 2 - (https://learnjavascript.online/) This is what I've been using for the last couple days and I've already learned as much from it as I have with MDN learning docs. It seems more up to date as well. I really like it. Still in the free chapters.
